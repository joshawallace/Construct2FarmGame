# Construct2FarmGame

Note: Construct2 with a valid license is required to run this project. 

This is an old game that I never finished in Construct2. Basic idea was to create a farming type of game. The game implements a basic inventory system, NPC dialogue, tile-mapping, and some basic resource gathering.
